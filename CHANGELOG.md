# Wingtips Changelog / Release Notes

All notable changes to `Wingtips` will be documented in this file. `Wingtips` adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Why pre-1.0 releases?

Wingtips is used heavily and is stable internally at Nike, however the wider community may have needs or use cases that we haven't considered. Therefore Wingtips will live at a sub-1.0 version for a short time after its initial open source release to give it time to respond quickly to the open source community without ballooning the version numbers. Once its public APIs have stabilized again as an open source project it will be switched to the normal post-1.0 semantic versioning system.

## [0.14.1](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.14.1)

Released on 2017-11-14.

### Fixed

- Fixed `WingtipsSpringBootProperties` and `WingtipsZipkinProperties` to not be a Spring `@Component`. This was causing
multiple-bean-definition errors when component scanning those classes. Those springboot autoconfig classes now work
when component scanning or when manually imported into an application.
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#61](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/61).
- Fixed `WingtipsSpringBootConfiguration` to set `RequestTracingFilter` to the highest precedence so that it will
execute as the first Servlet filter, since overall-request-spans should encompass as much of the request as possible.
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#62](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/62).
    
## [0.14.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.14.0)

Released on 2017-11-06.

### Added

- Added `ExecutorServiceWithTracing` to automate having tracing state hop threads when using `Executor` or 
`ExecutorService` to do work on async threads. See the 
[async section of the main readme](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips#async_usage), the 
[readme for the Java 8 module](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/tree/master/wingtips-java8), or the javadocs on 
`ExecutorServiceWithTracing` for usage examples. 
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#58](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/58).
    
### Removed

- Removed the "auto resurrect tracing state from SLF4J MDC" behavior from `Tracer` when the tracing state doesn't exist 
in `Tracer` explicitly. This was possible with some SLF4J implementations where MDC state is inherited by child threads,
however this could cause spans to hop threads when you don't want them to (e.g. long-lived background threads). We now 
have helper classes and methods for explicitly and intentionally hopping threads in a way that isn't surprising like 
the MDC auto-resurrect behavior so those features should be used instead for async thread-hopping. Note that this 
brings Wingtips in line with Logback, which also intentionally removed the "MDC inheritance in child thread" behavior 
for similar reasons (see the Logback version 1.1.5 notes in the [logback changelog](https://logback.qos.ch/news.html)). 
For Wingtips users that relied on this auto-resurrection-from-MDC behavior in Wingtips please refer to the
[async section of the main readme](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips#async_usage) and/or the
[readme for the Java 8 module](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/tree/master/wingtips-java8) for information on 
explicitly and intentionally causing tracing state to hop threads.
    - Removed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#57](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/57).    
    
## [0.13.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.13.0)

Released on 2017-10-25.

### Added

- Added support for Spring and Spring Boot projects, both on the incoming-request side and 
propagating-tracing-downstream side (via Spring's `RestTemplate` HTTP client). Please see the readmes for the 
[wingtips-spring](wingtips-spring/), [wingtips-spring-boot](wingtips-spring-boot/), and 
[wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot](wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot/) modules for details and usage examples.
    - Added by [Ale≈° Justin][contrib_alesj] in pull request [#37](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/37)
    - and by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#51](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/51).
- Added support for the Apache HTTP Client. See the [wingtips-apache-http-client](wingtips-apache-http-client/)
module readme for details and usage examples.
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#53](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/53).  

### Fixed

- Fixed `RequestTracingFilter` to work properly for both Servlet 2.x and Servlet 3+ environments. Part of this fix 
includes *not* exposing Servlet API as a transitive dependency of the `wingtips-servlet-api` module. This means you may 
need to pull in the Servlet API into your project if it's not already there, although it is usually provided by your 
Servlet container. See the
["Servlet API dependency required at runtime"](wingtips-servlet-api/README.md#servlet_api_required_at_runtime) section
of the `wingtips-servlet-api` readme for details.
    - Fixed by [woldie][contrib_woldie] in pull request [#48](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/48)
    - and by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull requests [#49](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/49) and
    [#52](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/52)
    - and with help from [Adrian Cole][contrib_adriancole], in particular some comments in pull request 
    [#49](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/49) that pointed us at the 
    [ServletRuntime](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/instrumentation/servlet/src/main/java/brave/servlet/ServletRuntime.java)
    class from [Brave](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave). 
    
## [0.12.1](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.12.1)

Released on 2017-09-27.

### Fixed

- Fixed `RequestTracingFilter` to work properly with async servlet requests. Previously the overall request span was
completing instantly when the endpoint method returned rather than waiting for the async request to finish. Tests have
been added that execute against a real running Jetty server equipped with `RequestTracingFilter` and several different
types of servlet endpoints - these tests prevent regression and verify proper Wingtips behavior for the following use 
cases: synchronous/blocking servlet, async servlet, blocking-forwarded servlet (using the request dispatcher to forward 
the request to a different blocking servlet), async-forwarded servlet (using the `AsyncContext.dispatch(...)` method to 
forward the request to a different async servlet), and an async servlet that errors-out due to hitting its request 
timeout.   
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#42](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/42). 
    
### Deprecated

- With the fixes to `RequestTracingFilter`, several methods and classes are no longer needed and have been marked 
`@Deprecated`. They will be removed in a future update. Full deprecation/migration instructions are in the `@deprecated` 
javadocs, but here is a short list:
    - `RequestTracingFilterNoAsync` class - this class is no longer needed since `RequestTracingFilter` is no longer
    abstract. Move to using `RequestTracingFilter` directly.
    - `RequestTracingFilter.isAsyncDispatch(HttpServletRequest)` method - this method is no longer needed or used by 
    `RequestTracingFilter`. It remains to prevent breaking subclasses that overrode it, but it will not be used. 
    - `RequestTracingFilter.ERROR_REQUEST_URI_ATTRIBUTE` field - this field is no longer used. If you still need it for
    some reason you can refer to `javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher.ERROR_REQUEST_URI` instead.   
    - Deprecated by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#42](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/42).

### Added

- [Added a warning to the readme](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips#try_with_resources_warning) about error handling 
and potentially confusing/non-obvious behavior when autoclosing `Span`s with `try-with-resources` statements.
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#43](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/43).
- Added several sample applications that show how Wingtips works in various frameworks and use cases. See their 
respective readmes for more information:
    - [samples/sample-jersey1](samples/sample-jersey1/)
    - [samples/sample-jersey2](samples/sample-jersey2/)
    - [samples/sample-spring-web-mvc](samples/sample-spring-web-mvc/)
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#44](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/44).
